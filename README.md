# Sunrise Alarm Clock
In an earlier post, I shared my code for how I shed light inside my closet early in the morning. If my wife and I got up at the same time, I'd use this for an ambient light alarm clock. This type of clock is more gentle. However, since I get up well before my wife, I use it instead to gently light my closet while I'm doing the early morning ninja routine.

Two options exist: Sense HAT and Unicorn HAT.
